BeQt - Beyond Qt

BeQt is a library set developed as an extension of Qt. That is where the
project's name comes from. BeQt may be useful in small and medium desktop
applications with classic interface. It takes most of routine work,
allowing one to focus on solving the actual task.

BeQt modules help one to quickly implement working with application
resources, plugin support, and user interface on-the-fly translation.
BeQt provides the means for convenient user commands handling in console
applications, and even it's own terminal emulator. Several frequently used
auxiliary widgets are also provided. Moreover, BeQt implements a ready-to-use
network client-server interaction model, based on Qt classes.
Entire module is dedicated to a simple yet powerfull text editor,
capable of spell check, automatic encoding detection,
and selecting text by rectangular blocks.
