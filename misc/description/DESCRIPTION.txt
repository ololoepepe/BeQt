BeQt is a library set, developed as an extension of Qt (or you may say a framework in a framework). That is where the project's name comes from.
BeQt is suitable for small and medium desktop applications, implementing such common features as:

 * Translating UI
 * Loading plugins
 * Showing About, Help and Settings dialogs
 * Storing basic application settings
